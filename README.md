# Final Project for CS217

The Final Project for CS217 will be an open-ended assignment done in teams
of at most 4, with focus on things covered in class. For your project, you may
choose any of the following.

  1. Implement an existing model such as ResNet, RNNs, etc.
  2. Iterative optimizers such as CG, proximal methods, etc.
  Describe the tradeoffs involved, especially those which change significantly
  between CPU/GPU and FPGAs. Many of the techniques described in [EE364B Lectures](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures.html) or CME302 would be appropriate for exploration.
  The primary motivation for these is for machine learning, so a motivation for the particular technique is necessary,
  along with a demonstration of it being applied.
  3. Low-precision computing / cheaper approximations. This might involve
  replacing training-time SELUs with RELUs for inference, or sigmoids with
  piecewise linear functions. Existing nets could be modified to use FixedPoint
  or FlexPoint.
  4. Something else (propose a different idea).

## Proposal
Your project proposal should be submitted on Gradescope, due 11/6. It should
include which of the options you are pursuing, and the goals of your project.
As much of this work is squarely in the research domain, your grade will not be
tied to how well you achieved these goals, but rather the degree to which your
team explored and documented the area.

If attempting option 4, please also include a segment on the motivation for the
work, as well as a brief description of prior work.
